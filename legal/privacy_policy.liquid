<p><strong>B. 	How We Use Your Information for Interest-Based Advertising</strong></p>

	<p>We may use third parties to measure and target advertisements for us about our products and services that are tailored to your online interests.

	<p>We also may display interest-based ads through Facebook, Twitter, or other social media platforms or websites.  This is done through the Facebook Custom Audiences, Twitter Tailor Audiences, or other similar business tools. These tools allow us to personalize our ads based on your shopping experience with us, without having to share your personal information with these social media platforms.  We do this only by sharing hashed information (which converts your email or phone number to a unique string of numbers and letters) that the social media platform then matches data against its own data for the limited purpose of serving advertisements (either directly to you or to other lookalike audiences).  The matched and unmatched hashes are then deleted, and are not used for any other purpose.</p>
