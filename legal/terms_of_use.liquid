Site will lie in the State and Federal courts located in the State

<h3>(18)&nbsp;ARBITRATION</h3>
<p><strong>You agree that agree that any dispute or claim arising
out of your use of the Site, including any dispute or claim as to
the application, enforceability, scope, or interpretation of this
agreement to arbitrate, shall be resolved by binding arbitration,
rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small
claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act
and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court
review of an arbitration award is limited.&nbsp; However, an
arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and
relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief, or
statutory damages), and must follow these Terms of
Use.&nbsp;</strong></p><strong></strong>
<p>Arbitration shall be administered by the Judicial Arbitration
and Mediation Services, Inc. ("JAMS"), pursuant to the JAMS
Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures effective July 1, 2014,
and conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Arbitration shall
take place by phone, unless an in-person hearing is requested by
either party. In that case, the hearing shall take place in the
county where you reside.&nbsp; To the extent this agreement to
arbitrate conflicts with the JAMS Policy on Consumer Arbitrations
Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural
Fairness (the "Minimum Standards"), the Minimum Standards in that
regard will apply.</p>
<p>Disputes may also be referred to another arbitration
organization if you and the Company agree in writing, or to an
arbitrator appointed pursuant to Section 5 of the Federal
Arbitration Act.</p>
<p>To start an arbitration proceeding, you must execute and serve a
Demand for Arbitration on the Company by mailing it to insert
address pursuant to the JAMS instructions. The Company will bear
the cost of your initial filing fee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be
conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class,
consolidated, or representative action.&nbsp;</u>If for any reason
a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration,&nbsp;<u>we
each waive any right to a jury trial.</u> We also both agree that
you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other
misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>
<h3>(19) ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h3>
<p>These Terms and the Privacy Policy contain the entire agreement
